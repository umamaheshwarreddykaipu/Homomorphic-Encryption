# Homomorphic-Encryption
The rapid adoption of cloud computing has revolutionized the way organizations store, process, and manage 
data. Cloud platforms offer scalable resources, on-demand services, and cost-effective solutions, making them 
attractive for businesses and individual users alike. However, with the benefits of cloud computing come 
significant security challenges. As more sensitive data is outsourced to cloud servers, ensuring data 
confidentiality and privacy during storage and computation becomes crucial. Traditional encryption techniques 
safeguard data at rest and in transit, but they fall short when it comes to performing operations on the data 
without first decrypting it, thus exposing it to potential security risks. 

To address this limitation, homomorphic encryption (HE) has emerged as a transformative approach. Unlike 
conventional encryption schemes, homomorphic encryption allows computations to be performed directly on 
encrypted data without revealing the plaintext. This property makes it an ideal solution for maintaining data 
privacy in cloud environments where sensitive information must be processed and analyzed. With homomorphic 
encryption, data owners can securely outsource their computations to untrusted cloud providers without 
compromising the confidentiality of their information. The resulting encrypted output can be decrypted by the 
data owner to obtain the final result, all while ensuring that the data remains secure throughout the entire 
lifecycle.
