# Homomorphic-Encryption
The rapid adoption of cloud computing has revolutionized the way organizations store, process, and manage 
data. Cloud platforms offer scalable resources, on-demand services, and cost-effective solutions, making them 
attractive for businesses and individual users alike. However, with the benefits of cloud computing come 
significant security challenges. As more sensitive data is outsourced to cloud servers, ensuring data 
confidentiality and privacy during storage and computation becomes crucial. Traditional encryption techniques 
safeguard data at rest and in transit, but they fall short when it comes to performing operations on the data 
without first decrypting it, thus exposing it to potential security risks. 

To address this limitation, homomorphic encryption (HE) has emerged as a transformative approach. Unlike 
conventional encryption schemes, homomorphic encryption allows computations to be performed directly on 
encrypted data without revealing the plaintext. This property makes it an ideal solution for maintaining data 
privacy in cloud environments where sensitive information must be processed and analyzed. With homomorphic 
encryption, data owners can securely outsource their computations to untrusted cloud providers without 
compromising the confidentiality of their information. The resulting encrypted output can be decrypted by the 
data owner to obtain the final result, all while ensuring that the data remains secure throughout the entire 
lifecycle.

Among the various types of homomorphic encryption schemes, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is the most comprehensive and powerful. FHE enables arbitrary computations—both addition and multiplication—on encrypted data, allowing complex operations such as machine learning and statistical analysis to be performed without the need for decryption. Despite its potential, traditional FHE schemes have been criticized for their high computational overhead and complexity, which can hinder their practical application in real-world scenarios. These challenges have motivated researchers to explore alternative designs that reduce the complexity and improve the efficiency of FHE systems.
The above code focuses on  on an integer-based fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme tailored for enhancing cloud security. The integer-based approach simplifies the implementation by using basic arithmetic operations over integers rather than complex algebraic structures, which are typical in conventional FHE schemes. As a result, it offers a more practical and efficient solution for secure cloud computing. The proposed scheme allows encrypted data to be stored and computed upon without requiring decryption, ensuring that sensitive information is never exposed to cloud service providers or third parties.
The main contributions are as follows:
1.	Design and implementation of an integer-based FHE scheme: We introduce an integer-based FHE model that supports both additive and multiplicative homomorphisms, enabling complex operations to be executed on encrypted data while maintaining strong data security.
2.	Performance analysis: The proposed scheme is evaluated for computational efficiency and encryption strength, highlighting its feasibility for practical cloud applications.
3.	Enhanced cloud security: By leveraging integer-based FHE, our solution addresses core challenges in cloud security, such as data privacy and unauthorized access during computation.

The diagram illustrates a secure cloud interaction process where data owners engage with a cloud platform while ensuring the privacy and protection of their data through encryption. This method allows users to encrypt their data before sending it to the cloud, where it is processed without the need for decryption, ensuring that sensitive data is never exposed to unauthorized parties, even during cloud-based operations. This process can be visualized as having several key stages that emphasize encryption, interaction with the cloud, and decryption.
